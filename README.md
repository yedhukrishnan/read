I love [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and this project is truly inspired from it. A hackernews-like site where users can post articles and others can read and upvote it.

Seeing is believing.. See the alpha version here: [enigmatic-beyond-3722](https://enigmatic-beyond-3722.herokuapp.com/) (It is still under construction!)

Right Now, We Have:

* Read articles
* Post a new article
* Article categories
* User login (with username) for posting new articles

And, These Are Yet To Be Done:

* Create a new category
* Upvote an article
* Comment on an article (discussions)


#### Contributions?

Of course! I would love to see this changing from mine to ours. Help to improve this with:
* Comments
* Suggestions
* Improvements
* Pull Requests
